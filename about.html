        <p class="text">Helioptiles is a project by Simon Schober that is focused on production-heavy electronic music and sound design <br /> This website has been created as a more private way to publish songs as an alternative to big streaming, so I don't have to pay attention to stuff like copyright or revenue. <br /> Honestly, I just wanna release my songs and not have to get them up to standards for big streaming, so I release them here. <br /> Have a good one :)</p>
